# Novo Earbuds AJAX App

This project is the AJAX version of my Novo Earbuds page. I used the Fetch API, the template element, and SASS to make the content dynamic. The hotspot information and materials list both come from the API, and the page updates when the data loads. There is also a loading spinner and an error message for the materials section.
